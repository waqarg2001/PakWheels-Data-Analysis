## Overview

<p><a href='pakwheels.com' target='_blank'>PakWheels</a> is the largest online marketplace for car shoppers and sellers in Pakistan. It aggregates thousands of new, used, and certified second-hand cars from thousands of dealers and private sellers.</p>

This project involves Extract Transform Load(ETL) process on used and new cars dataset which was scraped from PakWheels . Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is performed on it using Jupyter Notebook to extract key insights about the Pakistan's used cars marketplace.

## Tools 

To build this project, following tools were used:

- Python
- PyCharm
- Github
- Jupyter Notebook

## Architecture

The architecture of this project is straightforward which can be understood by the following diagram.

<p align='center'>
  <img src='https://github.com/waqarg2001/PakWheels-Data-Analysis/blob/7b23ca6ab3df0c13053a73f5a91e5544becd2ff0/resources/architecture.gif' height=280 width=900>
</p>  

According to the diagram we first create a python script which performs ETL for us on the raw dataset. The output of this process is clean data which is then used for exploratory analysis in Jupyter Notebook.


## Demo

The figure below shows a snapshot of ETL process being conducted through terminal. Type run.py (raw data directory).
(figure may take few seconds to load)
